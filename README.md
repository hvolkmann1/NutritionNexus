# NutritionNexus
This project aims at streamlining my daily nutrition.

I want it to generate a meal plan that maintains broad nutrition goals, i.e. calories, macro nutrients, and more. 
Considering adding a feature to take pictures of products I buy and training a network (or tuning one) to pull out the relative information and using that as the constraints on the meals...
It should be able to recommend ingredients to buy that would go well with what I currently have.
